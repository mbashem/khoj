        <h4 id="sec1.1">1.1 Purpose</h4>
        <p>
            Purpose of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to describe the specification and description of our project 'Somachar'. This Software Requirements Specification illustrates, in clear terms, the system's primary uses and required functionality so that the clients and other developers can easily understand what we did and how to change anything if it is required.

        <h2 style="color:#5FD3BC;">2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p>This section deals with a broad overview of the product Somachar â€“ News Platform, explaining the functionalities and goals that the software aims to achieve. It also provides details on the dependencies, constraints, operating environment of the product along with user classes and user manuals.</p>
        <h4 id="sec2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
        <p>Somachar is the new smart newspaper, since everything is turning digital the application itself will find out the desired news from verified sources and read it aloud to the user. By this, Old people who have trouble using smart devices or peoples with eye problems will also be able to listen to news, on the go without presence of Television. The app would be the new smart medium to get recent news delivered to your phone. This app will be available for both web and android </p>
        <h4 id="sec2.2">2.2 Product Functions</h4>
        <p>The product functions are not so heavily user dependent as the perspective of this app is to make it easier for the user to listen and find news online. Admins function is to keep checking to make sure the crawlers are deployed up and running. In order to make the functions comprehensible, a use case diagram of the user (actor ) is demonstrated below</p>
         <img src="src/use_case.png" alt="KotoUI" style="width:60%">
          <p style="font-size:90%"><i><center>Figure: Actor(user) and the Use-cases </i></center></p>
        <h4 id="sec2.3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
        <p>The android app and web will be mainly focused onto the user, user will be able to use the app with or without signing into the app. The admins job is preliminary straight forward, they can update the scripts when ever the newspapers upgrade their style format and due to the security issues the admins wonâ€™t be able to access the data of the users. Users will be able to use the voice search command to search for their desired news and listen or read it as they want.</p>
        <h4 id="sec2.4">2.4 Operating Environments</h4>
        <p> The operating environment of <b>Somachar</b> is listed as follows:
        <!-- For listing the attributes -->
        <ul> <li> Distributed Database </li>
             <li> Client/Server System </li>
             <li> Operating System: any system that supports a modern web browser, android version 5.0+ </li>
             <li> Database Configuration: Django and Google Firebase / SQLite </li>
             <li> Platform: Web and Android </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="sec2.5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
        <p>The mobile application of the product is currently designed for android users only. To store the news the crawlers scrape the targeted newspaper websites and store the scraped data into SQL database, later on that data is retrieved to be shown into the app and web </p>
        <h4 id="sec2.6">2.6 User Documentation</h4>
        <p>The product will provide users basic instructions to run . and A short tutorial video demonstrating the final software product</p>
        <h4 id="sec2.7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
        <p>The user of the system requires a smart-phone with an Android Operating System of version as early as 5.0 Lollipop with a microphone will be accessed via the app to listen to the voice search command of the user. The user should also have an internet connection to upload because to fetch the search results from the server. For this speech recognition algorithm we used Googleâ€™s Text to Speech API. It is assumed that users will only use google as a social media sign in platform</p>
        <br><br><br>


        <h2 style="color:#5FD3BC;">3. External Interface</h2>
        <h4 id="sec3.1">3.1 User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>When the user uses the service for the first time, they will be prompted the registration page. Already registered users can select to login through a button which will bring them to a login page. They can also use their Google account to sign in. If the user is already logged into the system, they will land on the home page. The home page will show the most recent news. They will be able to find news from search option and will be able to check the source of news.</p>

        <h4 id="sec3.2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h4>
        <p>'Somachar' app doesnâ€™t require any special hardware rather than a microphone.</p>

        <h4 id="sec3.3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h4>
        <p>Both the mobile application and the website will communicate with the database via internet. The operating system will provide such interfaces. Both the platforms will consist of operations regarding read and write of data.</p>

        <h4 id="sec3.4">Communications Interfaces</h4>
        <p> The application will send audio to Googleâ€™s Could server to analyze and will receive text data that has been recognized in the audio. It will also send text receive Audio data from Googleâ€™s Text-to-speech sever. All this occurs via HTTP requests and the audio and data transferred are encrypted by Googleâ€™s technology. </p>
        <br><br><br>
