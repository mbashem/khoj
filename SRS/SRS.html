        <h4 id="sec1.4">1.4 Product Scope</h4>

        <p>

          The purpose of KHOJ is to provide search engine capabilities that are confined to a specified domain.
          The user will provide a set of URLs that will be the basis of the search. The user can also provide the depth
          of the search. KHOJ will start crawling through these URLs and collect the data (whose type can also be
          specified by the user). Every webpage that is within the depth constraints will be searched,crawled and their
          data scraped,processed and stored.
          After the data is ready the user will be notified and will be given the ability to use the search engine to
          retrieve data relevant to what the user is looking for.
          KHOJ is mainly aimed at researchers who need information from certain websites rather than the whole internet.
          We hope that the targeted searching capabilities will save time and allow our users to gather relevant
          information in a better way.

        <h2 style="color:#3f5cab;">2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p>This section deals with a broad overview of the product 'KHOJ' as a search engine, explaining the
          functionalities and goals that the software aims to achieve. It also provides details on the dependencies,
          constraints, operating environment of the product along with user classes and user manuals.</p>

        <h4 id="sec2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
        <p> This product is a self-contained product. It mainly originated from the need of certain users to search data
          confined to a limited domain, unlike Google or Bing where searches are done across their whole database. KHOJ
          aims to provide a fast and fluid system to allow our users to get the data they actually need in a reasonable
          amount of time. </p>

        <h4 id="sec2.2">2.2 Product Functions</h4>
        <p>The product functions are user dependent as the perspective of this app is to make it easier for the user to search data within the user provided URLs. Admins function is to create new crawling strategies as plugins. Builtin crawling strategies will be all .txt files, PDF files, MS-Word files, non-HTML files etc meaning that 
        the user wants to search the data in these files inside the given URLS. In order to make the functions comprehensible, a use case diagram of the user and admin is demonstrated below - </p>
        <img src="src/UseCase327.jpg" alt="KotoUI" style="width:60%">
        <p style="font-size:90%"><i>
            <center>Figure: Actors and the Use-cases
          </i></center>
        </p>



        <h4 id="sec2.3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
        <p> The user can access the software ‘KHOJ’ from two different platforms: Web and Android App. There are 2 kinds
          of actors for the software who are the Users, and the admin. Users can access the software from both the web
          and phone app but admin can only access it through the web. Both the actors need to sign in first to use the
          software. The only job of an admin is to add new crawling strategies as a plugin. The users can create and use
          search clusters. A search cluster consists of several URLs with one or more crawling strategies and
          search-depth.
          The crawling strategy indicates the type of data and files the software would crawl and fetch data. Users will
          be able to use the search feature with both text and voice search commands to search from the mobile app but
          not create clusters. </p>



          


        <h4 id="sec2.4">2.4 Operating Environments</h4>
        <p> The operating environment of <b>KHOJ</b> is listed as follows: <br>

          <!-- For listing the attributes -->
        <ul>
          <li> Platform: Web and Android </li>
          <li>Web server: Any operation system with Python 3.9 and poetry installed.</li>
          <li> Client System: Any system with a modern web browser or for android with android version 7.0+</li>
          <li> Database Configuration: Postgresql </li>
          <li> Indexing Server: Solr </li>
        </ul>


        <h4 id="sec2.5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
        <p>
          For mobile, only android is supported for now and users can search both with text and voice in addition to the
          operations they can do on the web. People using devices with Android versions lower than 7 can not use the
          android version of this application. For voice search, it relies on google speech to text functionality and
          will not work if Google is down.
        </p>



        <h4 id="sec2.6">2.6 User Documentation</h4>
        <p>The product will provide users with basic running instructions. and A short tutorial video that shows how to
          use the entire software.</p>

        <h4 id="sec2.7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
        <p>To utilize the system, the user must have a working internet connection. For web users, there must be a
          browser to access the product. The phone user must also have a minimum of Android version 7 installed. It may
          take up to 24 hours for a cluster to become usable after it has been created with the URLs.The user will be
          notified via email when the cluster is ready. This product, once again, is reliant on the Google sign-in
          platform's API and Google speech to text API. The product could be affected if these assumptions are
          incorrect, are not shared, or change.</p>
        <br><br><br>


        <h2 style="color:#3f5cab;">3. External Interface</h2>
        <h4 id="sec3.1">3.1 User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>The user will be taken to the home page first. The user will be able to log in and register with Google credentials. There are two ways to use this system. Searching by text and creating clusters to add links are the two approaches.  For creating clusters, there will be a form. The user will add links to that cluster by filling out the form with necessary information such as depth.  It could take a maximum of 24 hours to crawl and collect the specific data. When the data is ready, the user will be notified through email. For searching by text, a search box will appear to the user. Then they will enter the text and select the clusters that users have added. The system will show some part of the corresponding text result with the URLs.then. To exit from the system, there will be a Log out button.</p>
         
          <div class="newpage">
        <h4 id="sec3.2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h4>
        <p> The mobile app version of the software 'KHOJ' might need a microphone to avail text to speech search
          feature. </p>
          </div>
        <h4 id="sec3.3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h4>
        <p>'Khoj' mainly relies on the following : <br>
            <b>Python Scrapy</b> - To crawl, scrape and export the data from webpages. This framework provides a very efficient and easy system to scrape data from the web. When the user provides a URL to 'KHOJ', this URL will be passed to a crawler in Scrapy which will then start gathering data starting from that URL. <br>
            <b>Lucene</b> - To index and query, the data that Scrapy will export, Lucene will be used which is a Java based library that deals with all sorts of operations relating to text, the two of which 'KHOJ' will use the most are indexing and retrieving data. <br>
            <b>Apache Solr</b> - This is a search engine, which provides the search capabilities of Lucene via HTTP requests. The scraped data from webpages will be fed to Solr to be stored and indexed. When  the user performs a search, Solr will be used to query the data via HTTP requests and return a response. <br>
            <b>Django</b> - This will be the framework that will be used to design the main web app. <br>
            <b>Postgresql</b> - This will be the database where 'KHOJ' will store the raw text data that Scrapy will extract.
        </p>

        <h4 id="sec3.4">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h4>
        <p>
          The application will send data to Solr through Solr API for indexing and querying. From android application
          will communicate through its rest API. From android google speech to text will be used for voice queries. All
          these communications will happen via HTTP. For authentication, google sign in will be used. Security will be
          granted by google.
        </p>

        <br><br><br>

        <!--System Features-->
        <h2 style="color:#3f5cab;">4. System Features</h2>
        <p>The system features stated below are the core building blocks for the 'KHOJ' application. </p>

        <h2 style="color:#3f5cab;">5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2>
        <h4 id="sec5.1"> 5.1 Performance Requirements</h4>
        <p><b>Text search: </b>When searching through a cluster,the system should not take more than a few seconds to start returning results. Users might often have many
          things to search for, so each search operation needs to be very quick or else the user's experience may not be satisfactory.<br>
          <b>Data: </b> Large volumes of data can be scraped off of websites so the system needs to be able to handle this.<br>
            <b>Mobile App: </b> Needs to be lightweight and responsive.<br>
            <b>Database: </b>Needs to be suited for handling the raw data that will be scraped. If this is slow it might bottleneck the whole system.</p> 

        <h4 id="sec5.2"> 5.2 Safety Requirements</h4>
        <p> The URLs that the user provides to the system to be crawled has to be provided by the own risk of the user. The user has to make sure 
        that the URLs allow the system to crawl and scrape data. </p>



        <h4 id="sec5.3"> 5.3 Security Requirements</h4>
        <p>The system shall not disclose any personal information about the users. The Application shall not grant
          access to an unauthorized user and the Application shall not communicate with any other devices or servers
          while in use by the user. The system will preserve the copyright of the content that has been crawled and indexed
          since it will not show the data that has been crawled rather refer to the URL source of the data to the user.
          Moreover, if any URL has a policy to prevent scraping the data, the system would not crawl or scrape that URL.
           </p>
